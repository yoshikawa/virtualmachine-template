{"name":"ruby_rbenv","version":"2.0.7","description":"Manages rbenv and installs Rbenv based Rubies","long_description":"# Chef ruby_rbenv Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sous-chefs/ruby_rbenv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sous-chefs/ruby_rbenv) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/ruby_rbenv.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ruby_rbenv)\n\n## Description\n\nManages [rbenv][rbenv_site] and its installed Rubies.\n\nSeveral custom_resources are defined facilitate this.\n\n**WARNING**: As of version 1.0 this cookbook was renamed from rbenv to ruby_rbenv so it could be uploaded to the Supermarket.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Chef\n\nThis cookbook requires Chef 12.9+.\n\n### Platform\n\n- Debian derivatives\n- Fedora\n- macOS\n- RHEL derivatives (RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, Oracle, Scientific Linux)\n- openSUSE and openSUSE leap\n\n# Usage\n\n_Please read_\n\nExample installations are provided in test/fixtures/cookbooks/test/recipes/\n\nA `rbenv_system_install` or `rbenv_user_install` is required to be set so that rbenv knows which version you want to use, and is installed on the system.\n\n## Gem\n\nUsed to install a gem into the selected rbenv environment.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_gem 'gem_name' do\n  options # Optional: Options to pass to the gem command e.g. '--no-rdoc --no-ri'\n  source # Optional: source URL/location for gem.\n  timeout # Optional: Gem install timeout\n  version # Optional: Gem version to install\n  response_file # Optional: response file to reconfigure a gem\n  rbenv_version # Which rbenv verison to install the gem to. Defaults to global\nend\n```\n\n## Global\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_global '2.3.4' do\n  user # Optional: if passed sets the users global version. Do not set, to set the systems global version\nend\n```\n\nIf a user is passed in to this resource it sets the global version for the user, under the users root_path (usually `~/.rbenv/version`), otherwise it sets the system global version.\n\n## Plugin\n\nInstalls a rbenv plugin.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_plugin 'ruby-build' do\n  git_url # Git URL of the plugin\n  git_ref # Git reference of the plugin\n  user # Optional: if passed installs to the users rbenv. Do not set, to set installs to the system rbenv.\nend\n```\n\nIf user is passed in, the plugin is installed to the users install of rbenv.\n\n## Rehash\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_rehash 'rehash' do\n  user 'vagrant' # Optional: if passed rehashes the user Ruby otherwise rehashes the system rbenv\nend\n```\n\n## Ruby\n\nInstalls a given Ruby version to the system or user location.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_ruby '2.3.4' do\n  user # Optional: If passed the user rbenv to install to\n  rbenv_action # Optional: the action to perform, install, remove etc\nend\n```\n\nShorter example `rbenv_ruby '2.4.1'`\n\n## Script\n\nRuns a rbenv aware script.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_script 'foo' do\n  rbenv_version #rbenv version to run the script against\n  environment # Optional: Environment to setup to run the script\n  user # Optional: User to run as\n  group # Optional: Group to run as\n  path # Optional: User to run as\n  returns # Optional: Expected return code\n  code # Script code to run\nend\n```\n\n## System_install\n\nInstalls rbenv to the system location, by default `/usr/local/rbenv`\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_system_install 'foo' do\n  git_url # URL of the plugin repo you want to checkout\n  git_ref # Optional: Git reference to checkout\n  update_rbenv # Optional: Keeps the git repo up to date\nend\n```\n\n## User_install\n\nInstalls rbenv to the user path, making rbenv available to that user only.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_user_install 'vagrant' do\n  git_url # Optional: Git URL to checkout rbenv from.\n  git_ref # Optional: Git reference to checkout e.g. 'master'\n  user # Which user to install rbenv to (also specified in the resources name above)\nend\n```\n\n## System-Wide Mac Installation Note\n\nThis cookbook takes advantage of managing profile fragments in an `/etc/profile.d` directory, common on most Unix-flavored platforms. Unfortunately, Mac OS X does not support this idiom out of the box, so you may need to [modify][mac_profile_d] your user profile.\n\n## Development\n\n- Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n- Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome!
